# Finding_Ideal_Replacement_for_Aging_Football_Forwards_Using_Unsupervised_Learning

Prior to the ageing of prolific forwards amongst top European clubs, there are some signs of diminishing returns in their prolificity, hence the need for an ideal replacement for this aging forwards can not be overemphasized.

Manchester City, Leicester City & Chelsea contracted me to find an ideal replacemants and better alternatives for their ageing forwards in :


Sergio Ag√ºero, 31

Jammy Vardy, 32

Oliver Giroud, 33

The dataset contains a scout list with a number top forwards across the globe enlisting their abilities, stats and performance level or index which was compiled by a Chief Scout in Europe. I'll be using the forwards in the scout list to find the ideal replacement of this ageing top forwards


In this mission:

1. Create an initial cluster using the kMeans Model

2. Train a model on the entire dataset using kMeans Model

3. Find ideal replacements for the ageing forwards

4. Find better alternatives for the ageing forwards
